# Customer Behavior Analysis

## Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior using a structured data analytics workflow. It covers data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), data cleaning, SQL-based analysis using MSSQL, dashboard creation with Power BI, report generation, and exporting results as a PDF using Gamma. The goal is to derive meaningful business insights from customer data in a clear and professional manner.

This project is suitable for demonstrating practical data analytics skills, end-to-end workflow understanding, and tool integration.

## Dataset

* The dataset contains customer-related information such as purchases, ratings, demographics, and behavior patterns.
* Data is loaded and processed using Python.
* The dataset is cleaned to handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies before analysis.

*(Dataset source can be updated here if it is public or shared)*

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading**

   * Import dataset into Python using Pandas.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Understand data structure and distributions.
   * Identify trends, patterns, and outliers.

3. **Data Cleaning**

   * Handle missing and null values.
   * Remove duplicates.
   * Standardize column formats and data types.

4. **SQL Analysis**

   * Store cleaned data in PostgreSQL/MySQL.
   * Run SQL queries for aggregations, filtering, and insights.

5. **Dashboard Creation**

   * Build an interactive Power BI dashboard.
   * Visualize key metrics and customer trends.

6. **Reporting**

   * Summarize insights and findings.
   * Export the final report as a PDF using Gamma.
